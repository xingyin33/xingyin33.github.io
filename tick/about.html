	<h1>This site is dedicated to the collection of great Chinese films. </h1> <p>Two decades ago the Chinese directors the Chinese directors Zhang Yimou and Chen Kaige were the kings of the arthouse world. Their films, including Raise the Red Lantern and Farewell My Concubine, reaped respectable box-office, critical praise, and an astonishing haul of awards at major festivals: six prizes at Cannes, five Oscar nominations, Baftas, awards at Venice and Berlin. In recent years, however, the Chinese film industry has changed so rapidly as to make the Chinese cinema faded into insignificance. But we can still find few excellent works. As a Chinese, I hope the culture of China can be widely spread around the world. So I share the list of films (list in no particular order). I hope you enjoy it! </p>
