      <p>
      Before game trailers and the Internet age, even before magazines, our first contact with video games was the cover art on the front of the box. That’s the image that “sold” the game. It was the promise of an experience, and an extrapolation of game play regardless of the game’s actual graphical capability.  
      </p>


<p> A vast marketing machine would grow around the advertising and release of the game. The games at the time that were basically abstract concepts represented by a couple of pixels on the screen with a few beeps thrown in for good measure. How do you make those games compelling?</p>

<p>You do it by using your packaging to tell a bigger story about what the game is about and asking consumer to use their imagination. They hired talented artists to design the packaging and cartridge art. All of these talented people had varied backgrounds, from commercial art to concept art for NASA, but they all had one thing in common. They could take a simple idea and translate it into a visual reality that the consumer could use to enhance their gameplay experience.</p>

<p>Some might say that this practice “misleading”. While this art may misrepresent what you are going to be playing, but it makes total sense when you look at the art in the context of the time it was released and try to understand how it was useful to gamers during this period.</p>

<p>Modern audiences who have grown up with realistic graphics scoff at these simpler times, but that is because they lack insight into how these games were consumed. When you were driving a pixel block around a track that was supposed to represent a car, you were using your imagination to picture an Indy race car. This took added creativity by the players of the game, but coming up with your vision for the game along with a complete backstory and narrative just made the game that much more endearing. Here is where the art comes in, it gave you a nudge in the right direction. Not showing what you would see, but what you should see when you play the game.</p>

<p>Here’s the collection of box art for the old game cartridges  along with a filter for different gaming systems. Maybe seeing them side by side will jar some great memories, or if you never played these games before, give you some insight into how early gamers dealt with the disadvantages of early technology.</p>

<p>While graphics continue to get better and we move into immersive worlds that trick our brains into accepting technical realities. Undoubtedly we will spend long periods of time in these new games, but you got to ask yourself, how much of this technological advancement is necessary. 40 years ago, people would spend the same amount of time pushing single pixels across the screen and deriving the same amount of pleasure that we do today. So maybe those expensive processors aren’t what game designers should be trying to tap into, but instead they should be looking at the human imagination. It is more powerful than any computer we can make now, it is upgradable and most important, it comes standard on all people.  </p>
